/*
Given an array of integers arr, your task is to count the number of contiguous subarrays that represent a sawtooth sequence of at least two elements.

For arr = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5], the output should be countSawSubarrays(arr) = 4. Since all the elements are arranged in decreasing order,
it wonâ€™t be possible to form any sawtooth subarray of length 3 or more. There are 4 possible subarrays containing two elements, so the answer is 4.

For arr = [10, 10, 10], the output should be countSawSubarrays(arr) = 0. Since all of the elements are equal, none of subarrays can be sawtooth, so the answer is 0.

For arr = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], the output should be countSawSubarrays(arr) = 10.

All contiguous subarrays containing at least two elements satisfy the condition of the problem. There are 10 possible contiguous subarrays
containing at least two elements, so the answer is 10.

HINT: 3


This can be solved by just splitting the array into multiple sawtooth sequences..which is O(n) operation.
For example [1,2,1,3,4,-2] can be splitted into two sequence [1,2,1,3] and [3,4,-2] and now we just have to do C(size,2) operation for both the parts.

Answer:

    public int countSeq(int[] arr) {
        int len = arr.length;
        if (len < 2) {
          return 0;
        }

        int s = 0;
        int e = 1;
        int sign = arr[e] - arr[s];
        int count = 0;

        while (e < len) {
          while (e < len && arr[e] - arr[e-1] != 0 && isSameSign(arr[e] - arr[e-1], sign)) {
            sign = -1 * sign;
            e++;
          }
          // the biggest continue subsequence starting from s ends at e-1;
          int size = e - s;
          count = count + (size * (size - 1)/2); // basically doing C(size,2)
          s = e - 1;
          e = s + 1;
        }
        return count;
    }

I think the trick here is to realise that: assuming you have a valid sawtooth sequence of length x, adding one additional
valid element would increase the number of subsequences by x too.

Example:

[1,2,1] is a valid sawtooth sequence.

adding 2 to this valid sequence of [1,2,1] forms [1,2,1,2]. We see here that adding a new element to a valid sequence of length
 3 here adds 3 new valid subsequences which are: [1,2,1,2],[2,1,2], and [1,2].

Correspondingly, adding another valid element such as -1 to [1,2,1,2] would add 4 new subsequences which are: [1,2,1,2,-1], [2,1,2,-1],[1,2,-1],and [2,-1].

Thus, what we can use a moving window with left and right pointers l and r to keep track of the length of valid sequence,
resetting the l pointer when an invalid sequence is detected.

def solution(arr: list) -> int:
    '''
    for every char, check if still current sawtooth
    if still currently sawtooth, numberOfWays += length
    else reset temp counter
    '''
    l, r = 0, 1
    ways = 0
    while r < len(arr):

        # check if current char + past 2 chars are sawtooth
        if r-l > 1 and (arr[r-2] < arr[r-1] > arr[r] or
                        arr[r-2] > arr[r-1] < arr[r]):
            ways += r-l

        # check if current char + past 1 chars are sawtooth
        elif arr[r-1] != arr[r]:
            ways += 1
            l = r-1

        else:
            # reset left pointer
            l = r

        r += 1
    return ways
